I'm a pianist. And I'm always on the lookout for new pieces to learn.

Recently, I picked up a copy of Shostakovich's 2nd Concerto, and I'm finding that it's probably one of the easiest concertos I've ever seen. The third movement seems to consist mostly of Hanon's "Virtuoso Pianist" exercises, and the second movement is entirely sight-readable. So that's one thing I'm learning.

Another thing that I'd like to learn is the third of Kapustin's eight preludes, entitled "Toccatina". Its raw speed and consistent *perpetuum-mobile* on the same note makes it quite a challenging learn, but I think given enough time I can work up to it.

The last thing that I really want to look at in detail is Poulenc's two-piano sonata -- I learned the first two movements about eight years ago but the third and fourth movements are by far my favourites.

Not really much else to say, other than perhaps it's time I went back and did some technical work. Scales and the like.
