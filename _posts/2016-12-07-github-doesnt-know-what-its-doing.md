### Don't rely on GitHub to be able to help you with your problems.

As part of setting up this blog, I had to redirect my existing webpage (ljenglish.net) to point to my GitHub .io page. One would expect this to be a well-documented exercise on the part of GitHub, Inc., right?

Actually, I found myself lost in a maze of documentation with no real direction as to what I should be doing re: DNS records and such.

The moral of this tiny little story is that Stack Overflow is full of people who have done this before, and if you need to set up a custom domain for your GitHub page, don't ask GitHub. You'll just get lost.

That having been said, you are now reading this blog post at my homepage! Congratulations to everyone involved.
