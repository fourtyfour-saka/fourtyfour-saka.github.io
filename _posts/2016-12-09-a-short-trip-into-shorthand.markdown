title: A short trip into shorthand.

I have been following the Anniversary Manual to Gregg Shorthand over the last couple of days, and I have "finished" the first two units. This has led me to a few realisations:

### Shorthand is going to be useless for me in the short term.

I thought that it might have been a good idea to learn to take notes at university, although for a number of reasons this will prove to be a poor thought. Firstly, I will most probably not be able to write fluently (~100wpm) for at least a year, disabling me from copying down speech. Secondly, important medicine-related words such as *diverticulitis*[^1] may be time-consuming to write in time even if I managed to learn to write fluently.

### Shorthand is inconsistent.

The manual that I'm following first details vowels as having two possible diacritics: a dot or a dash. These give three versions of the vowel sound (for example, the A vowel can make an [a] sound as in *hat*, an [ä] sound as in *calm*, or an [eɪ̯] sound as in *came*).
However, it immediately then goes on to say that the diacritics are never used because it's too slow to transcribe them, so reading shorthand back becomes a context-sensitive exercise where there is no salient difference between an earth*quake* and an earth*quack*.

### Taking notes is time-consuming.

One of the shortcomings of shorthand people seem to mention often is that you can't really come back to the shorthand notes after a prolonged period of time and expect to be able to read them well. Rs might turn into Ls, Ks into Gs and suddenly "the glass" turns into "the cress". A solution to this is to type up the notes when you have time later, usually in the same day, but transcribing entire lectures from shorthand is probably not as efficient as transcribing entire lectures from recordings, which are usually given in our technologically-advanced society.

This leads me to the conclusion that shorthand will mostly remain a hobby during university, perhaps becoming a more useful tool for taking minutes of meetings and places where scribing has remained necessary.
