Hi there. My name is Luke English, and I'm a computer scientist.

At least, that's what I used to tell people. In the beginning of 2017 I will be living in Brisbane, studying for a Doctor of Medicine at the University of Queensland.

I'd like to say I'm a completely rational person, but I'm sure you know that's not true. However, I do want to become a more rational person, and in general "become better". So I'm taking a few steps to do this, with thanks to [D_Malik's list of things](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5b8/insufficiently_awesome/3z5r).

Specifically, in addition to making observations about life in general, I'd like this blog to be a record of my knowledge and progress in the following areas:

* Medicine and the study thereof
    * (quite possibly the combination thereof with machine learning/compsci in general)
* [Mental Bayesian updating](https://arbital.com/p/61b/?startPath)
* [Gregg](http://gregg.angelfishy.net/) shorthand
* Music
* [N-back](http://www.gwern.net/N-back%20FAQ.html)
* more...

At any rate, I'm not sure how often I'm going to be updating, but I feel that in the pursuit of rationality, documentation is better than not. So I hope you enjoy reading of my efforts.

~ Luke
